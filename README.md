## read_data

`read_data.py` is a simple python script that reads weather data from a json file (see weather_data.json as an example) and plots the average temperature over days for a given city.

### Requirements

Since `read_data.py` runs in a isolated docker container you need to install Docker in your system.
Please follow the instructions from the [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#installation) official documentation.

### Usage

1. `git clone git@github.com:p3dr0migue1/cfweather.git`
2. `cd cfweather`
3. `sudo docker build -t cfweather .`
4. in the same directory as `read_data.py` create a directory named 'output' and `cd` into it
5. `sudo docker run --rm -v $PWD:/cfcore/output -u bob cfweather python /cfcore/read_data.py`

You should now have all the graphs and html template generated by `read_data.py` in the directory `output`.
